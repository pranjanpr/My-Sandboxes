# My-Sandboxes

This repo is going to admit few of my sandboxes which I have tried over few months back.

These are react js, tsx elements rare to find and difficult to produce.

These can be used directly(it's react-js isn't it), just make sure to add the required dependencies by looking into the imports.

Or you can play with these directly by copy pasting in a sandbox.
